Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms operate by animating each comparison and swap between data elements in real time. This project is designed to help users better understand algorithmic logic and performance through visual learning.

Features

Clean and responsive user interface for all screen sizes

Real-time animation of the Bubble Sort algorithm

Dynamic array generation with adjustable array sizes

Speed control slider for customizing animation speed

Color-coded sorting states for clear differentiation of algorithm steps:

Yellow: elements being compared

Red: elements being swapped

Green: elements in their final, sorted position

Technologies Used

HTML5 – Defines the structure and layout of the application

CSS3 – Handles styling, transitions, and visual responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6) – Implements sorting logic, animations, and user interactivity

How It Works

The application generates a random array of integers.

Each integer is represented as a vertical bar whose height is proportional to its value.

The Bubble Sort algorithm iteratively compares adjacent elements.

Bars change color to indicate comparisons and swaps as the algorithm progresses.

Once sorting is complete, all bars turn green to indicate the array is fully sorted.

Getting Started
